# pencil test

A traditional animation tool in the browser

## features

- onion skin
- save and load films

## usage

  Draw in the white box.

  Spacebar to play.

  Right-click for options.
^^^ white-space only changes

## caveats

Films are saved to Local Storage, so they will disappear if you clear your
browser's cache.

The "undo" option simply removes the last stroke on a drawing. It cannot be
recovered, except to load a saved film.

This version has only been tested in Google Chrome (Linux, Mac, Android).

## todo

- Export to a video, GIF, or SWF format.
